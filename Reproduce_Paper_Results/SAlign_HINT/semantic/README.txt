copy the alignemnt folder into semantic folder before running the cammand to calculate AFS.

Line number 13 of gosemsim-greedy.r/gosemsim-mc.r file is used to specify the speice and line number 21 is used to specify alignment filename.
Line number 25 is used to specify the output file.

average_semantic_similarity_greedy / average_semantic_similarity_mc is used to calculate average semantic similairty and number of aligned nodes.

Line number 15 and 17 of average_semantic_similarity_greedy / average_semantic_similarity_mc are used to specify the semantic files for whwich average has to be computed.

NOTE: change the alignment number for every run of Monte-Carlo based alignment (we used average of 10 runs for Monte-Carlo based alignments).
Run 10 times all the files with different alignment number
